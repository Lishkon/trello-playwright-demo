## [Unreleased] - 2025-XX-XX

### Fixed
- **GitLab CI: Fixed Playwright test job failing with exit code 127**
  - Issue: YAML indentation error caused bash to execute `-` as a command after tests completed
  - Error: `/bin/sh: eval: line 191: -: not found`
  - Fix: Corrected indentation of `docker cp` command in `.gitlab-ci.yml` from 4 spaces to 2 spaces
  - Impact: Playwright HTML reports now properly copied from Docker container to GitLab artifacts
  - File: `.gitlab-ci.yml` - `playwright-tests` job script section
  - Fix: Pipeline gets executed even if the tests fail and the report is still available just like in case with the successful test completion.

### Changed
- **GitLab CI: Improved artifact handling for Playwright reports**
  - HTML reports now successfully uploaded as job artifacts
  - Reports accessible via GitLab UI "Browse" artifacts feature
  - Artifacts retention set to 30 days

### Technical Details
- Fixed YAML literal block scalar (`|`) indentation issue where `docker cp` command was incorrectly nested within the bash script block instead of being a separate script list item
- The `docker cp` command now executes as a separate GitLab CI script step, ensuring reports are extracted from the Docker container before cleanup
- Moved the `docker cp` command into the `after_script` section to prevent the preliminary failure when the test fails
- Added the echoing of `Test completed with exit code $?` in order to improve debugging of the failed tests
- Added the echoing of `Failed to copy report $?` into the `after_script` section in order to improve debugging of the failed tests
