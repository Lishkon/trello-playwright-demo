# 🎯 Trello Playwright Demo - UI Test Automation + Dockerized Jenkins CI

This project is a real-world demonstration of building a modern UI test automation framework using Playwright, combined with DevOps practices sush as:

- Containerized Jenkins (Dockerized CI environment)
- Automated test execution inside Playwright Linux images
- HTML reporting + artifact archiving
- Pipeline debugging, permission handling, and report publishing

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✔ Playwright Test Automation

- Page Object Model
- TOTP helper for authentication
- Stable selector architecture
- Cross-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

### ✔ DevOps / CI/CD

- Jenkins running inside Docker
- CI-mode Playwright runs (no GUI server, no hanging)
- Automated HTML report publishing
- Test artifact collection
- Clean pipeline retry logic & container isolation

### ✔ Stability Improvements

- Consistent error handling
- Corrected report duplication
- Fixed CI `reporter` brhavior
- Resolved Jenkins <docker.sock> permission limitations

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

You need the following installed locally:

- [ ] Docker Desktop
- [ ] Jenkins (Dockerized version)
- [ ] Node.js
- [ ] Git

👉 You do NOT need Playwright installed locally.
The tests run fully inside Dockerized Playwright images.

## 🔐 Environment Variables Setup - Local execution only

This project requires a `.env` file to store sensitive configuration values such as login credentials used by Playwright tests.
The `.env` file is not included in source control (it's ignored through `.gitignore`), so you must create it manually before running tests.

1. Create a .env file in the project root:
```bash
trello-playwright-demo/
│
├── .env        ← create this file here
├── tests/
├── pages/
├── helpers/
...
```
2. Add the required environment variables
   
Store your credentials within the `.env` file:

```bash
# ------------------------------
# Playwright Test Environment
# ------------------------------

# Trello/Atlassian Test Account
INVALID_USER_EMAIL=your-invalid-email
INVALID_USER_PASSWORD=your-invalid-password
USER_EMAIL=your-valid-email
USER_PASSWORD=your-invalid-password

# 2FA / TOTP (if applicable)
TOTP_SECRET=your-base32-secret-key
```

3. Save the file — nothing else is needed

Playwright loads `.env` automatically via dotenv (or via your helper functions loading from `process.env`).

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never commit .env
> Use the Jenkin's Credentials to run the tests in CI/CD
 
4. Set up the Jenkins Credentials - needed for running the tests in CI/CD:

Open the pipeline -> Configure -> Proceed to Pipeline section -> In the Repositories subsection, click on "+ Add" next to the Credentials field

Examples for your Trello project:
- `trello-e2e-user` – type: “Username with password”
- `trello-e2e-totp-secret` – type: “Secret text”
- Any API keys, etc. – also “Secret text”

Jenkins will encrypt these at rest and mask them in logs.

Inject the secrets into the Jenkinsfile in the 'Install & Test in Playwright image' stage:

```bash
steps{
  script {
      withCredentials([
      usernamePassword(
          credentialsId: 'trello-e2e-valid-user',
          usernameVariable: 'E2E_VALID_USER',
          passwordVariable: 'E2E_VALID_PASS'
      ),
      usernamePassword(
          credentialsId: 'trello-e2e-invalid-user',
          usernameVariable: 'E2E_INVALID_USER',
          passwordVariable: 'E2E_INVALID_PASS'
      ),
      string(
          credentialsId: 'TOTP_SECRET',
          variable: 'TOTP_SECRET'
      )
    ]) {
        // sh(...) here
    }
  }
}
```

Update the shell script to use the variables as parameters:

```bash
steps{
  script {
      withCredentials([
        // ...
        // Credential variables
        // ...
    ]) {
        sh '''
              set -eux

              docker rm -f pw-tests || true

              docker run --name pw-tests --pull=missing \
                -e CI=1 \
                -e USER_EMAIL=${E2E_VALID_USER} \
                -e USER_PASSWORD=${E2E_VALID_PASS} \
                -e INVALID_USER_EMAIL=${E2E_INVALID_USER} \
                -e INVALID_USER_PASSWORD=${E2E_INVALID_PASS} \
                -e TOTP_SECRET=${TOTP_SECRET} \
                // ...
                // rest of the script
                // ...
                "
            '''
    }
  }
}
```
Commit the changes and push to the origin branch.

## 🧪 Running Tests Locally (Optional, No Docker/Jenkins reqiored)

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run all tests: `npx playwright test`
3. Run only login tests: `npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts`
4. View Playwrght HTML Report: `npx playwright show-report`

---

## 🐳 Running the Jenkins CI Pipeline

1. Build Jenkins image

```bash
docker build -t trello-playwright-demo-jenkins -f Dockerfile.jenkins .
```

2. Run Jenkins container

```bash
docker run -d ^
  --name trello-jenkins ^
  -u root ^
  -p 4000:8080 ^
  -p 50000:50000 ^
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  -v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
  -v "C:\Users\<YOU>\trello-playwright-demo":/host_project ^
  trello-playwright-demo-jenkins
```

3. Open Jenkins

Go to:
```bash
http://localhost:4000
```

4. Create a Pipeline

Choose:

- Pipeline -> Pipeline script from SCM -> SCM: Git
- Expand the Repositories:
- Repo URL: `https://github.com/Lishkon/trello-playwright-demo.gi`
- Add the new credentials and make sure they show in the Credentials field - Refer to step 4 of the previous section
- Enter `*/main` as a Branch Specifier
- Provide `Jenkinsfile.groovy` asthe Script Path option

Jenkins will automatically:
- Launch Playwright test container
- Install dependencies
- Run tests in CI mode
- Copy out `playwright-report`
- Publish it as a clickable HTML report 🎉

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Challenges Solved

✔ 1. Docker socket permission denied

Solved by running Jenkins as root inside the container (`-u root`).

✔ 2. Playwright HTML report not generating

Playwright GUI server was stuck -> fixed by using:

```bash
CI=1 npx playwright test
```

✔ 3. Reporter path duplication

Playwright sometimes generated nested `/playwright-report/playwright-report` folders.
Solution: clean workspace & enforce correct output directory.

✔ 4. HTML Publisher plugin showing empty page

Caused by incorrect path.
Fixed by publishing:
```bash
playwright-report/index.html
```

✔ 5. Run the Pipeline
In Jenkins → open your job → click Build Now

You’ll see:

📦 Containerized Playwright test execution
✅ Test result summary in Jenkins
🖥 Full Playwright HTML report available as an artifact

## 🧾 Example Output
```java
Running 54 tests using 8 workers
✓ Login functionality › loads correctly (11.8s)
✓ Login functionality › invalid password shows error (10.2s)
...
```
In Jenkins:
- “Test Result” tab → shows passed/failed test counts
- “Playwright HTML Report” → opens full visual dashboard in new tab

## 💡 Next Steps
- Integrate with GitHub SCM for automatic builds
- Add Slack/email notifications
- Extend pipeline with Docker-based test runners
- Deploy Jenkins to a cloud VM (AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean)
